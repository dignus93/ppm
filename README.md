This project is a website made during the course "Programmazione E Produzione Multimediale" of the bachelor degree in computer engineering in Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze. 
It is a website that shows live tweets on three italian cities. You can login, search for hashtag and date period. There is also a function that let you draw a polygon on the map and search tweets in that zone. A demo video of the website can be found here:
